# AlgoMetrics
This repo contains C++ implementations of popular data structures and algorithms.
The goal is to create a comprehensive testing framework to study the effect of various input parameters on algorithm performance.

## Getting started

I'd recommend using VSCode with the [C++ compiler extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).

Clone the repo with    
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sriram-Sai-Ganesh/AlgoMetrics
```
You might need to install ```make```
